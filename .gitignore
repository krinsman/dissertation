## NumPy binary files -- large and I have a lot of them, 
## and they're all generated by the notebooks reproducibly anyway
*.npz
*.npz.BAK

## Auto-generated notebooks -- came up with this suffix
## 'ag' = 'auto-generated'
## specifically for them because there are a lot of them
## they tend to have pictures so be very large commits
## and already I might have to restart the repo from scratch b/c it has
## become too large because of these notebooks but at least moving forward
## they are generated files anyway so shouldn't be included in version control
##*.ag.ipynb

## Pickle files are massive, each is like 5 gigabytes binary blob
## so maybe not best thing to keep in a git repo, you know
